"""
In this assignment, you will implement linear and logistic regression
using the gradient descent method. To complete the assignment, please 
modify the linear_regression(), and logistic_regression() functions. 

The package `matplotlib` is needed for the program to run.
You should also try to use the 'numpy' library to vectorize 
your code, enabling a much more efficient implementation of 
linear and logistic regression. You are also free to use the 
native 'math' library of Python. 

All provided datasets are extracted from the scikit-learn machine learning library. 
These are called `toy datasets`, because they are quite simple and small. 
For more details about the datasets, please see https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html

Each dataset is randomly split into a training set and a testing set using a ratio of 8 : 2. 
You will use the training set to learn a regression model. Once the training is done, the code
will automatically validate the fitted model on the testing set.

    Linear regression using full batch gradient descent.
    A 1D array w should be returned by this function such that given a
    sample x, a prediction can be obtained by x^T w, where x is a column vector. 
    The intercept term can be ignored due to that x has been augmented by adding '1' as an extra feature. 
    If you scale the cost function by 1/#samples, you should use as learning rate alpha=0.001, otherwise alpha=0.0001  

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: a 2D array of size [N, f+1]
       where N is the number of samples, f is the number of features
    y: a 1D array of size [N]
